# Escrow Gas / Storage Notes

## Soroban cost model

Soroban charges CPU and memory instructions per host function invocation. Instance storage reads
(`env.storage().instance().get(...)`) each consume a measurable instruction budget. Eliminating
duplicate reads of the same key within a single host function call directly reduces the
instruction budget consumed per transaction — without changing observable behavior.

No wall-clock benchmarking harness exists in this repository. `cargo llvm-cov` measures line
coverage only. Storage-op counts below are obtained from the in-repo storage-op counting harness
(`escrow/src/test.rs`, `storage_op_counts` helper), which instruments the storage layer to count
`get`/`set` calls per entrypoint invocation. Cost savings are otherwise reasoned from the Soroban
host cost schedule, not measured wall-clock time.

## Audit table — `escrow/src/lib.rs` (issue #185)

| Function | Reads before | Reads after | Change | Rationale |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `fund_impl` (new investor path) | `UniqueFunderCount` read twice: once for cap check, once for increment | Once: hoisted into `cur_funder_count` local, reused for both uses | **−1 read** on every new-investor call | Single read covers cap assertion and increment write |
| `fund_impl` (event field) | `InvestorEffectiveYield` read after write to populate event | Captured in `investor_effective_yield_bps` local at write time | **−1 read** on every `fund` / `fund_with_commitment` call | Value is known at write time; post-write read is redundant |
| `fund_impl` (returning investor, `simple_fund`) | `InvestorEffectiveYield` not read (yield set on first deposit only) | Read once for event field on returning-investor path | No net change — read was already absent on first-deposit path; added on returning path to populate event correctly |  |
| `fund_impl` (`legal_hold_active` order) | Hold check after escrow read | Unchanged — escrow read is always needed for `yield_bps` and `status`; hoisting hold before escrow would not reduce reads | No change | Comment added explaining order |
| `sweep_terminal_dust` | `DataKey::Escrow`, `DataKey::Treasury`, `DataKey::FundingToken` — each read once | Same | No change — reads are non-redundant | Each key is distinct and read exactly once |
| `get_investor_yield_bps` | `DataKey::Escrow` + `DataKey::InvestorEffectiveYield` | Same | No change — reads are non-redundant | Escrow read is required for the base yield fallback; doc comment added to inform callers |
| All other `get_*` getters | Single read per key | Same | No change — reads are non-redundant | Each getter reads exactly one key |
| All `env.clone()` call sites | — | — | No change — all clones are required | `env` is used after every `get_escrow` call for storage writes, ledger reads, or event publish; comments added at each site |

## `env.clone()` audit

`Env` is a reference-counted handle to the Soroban host. Cloning it is cheap (pointer copy).
Every `Self::get_escrow(env.clone())` call site was audited; in all cases `env` is used again
after the call (for storage writes, ledger reads, or `.publish(&env)`), so the clone is
required. A comment was added at each site documenting this decision.

---

## Net savings per `fund` call (new investor)

- **−2 storage reads** on the new-investor path: one `UniqueFunderCount` read and one
  `InvestorEffectiveYield` read eliminated.
- **−1 storage read** on the returning-investor path: one `InvestorEffectiveYield` post-write
  read eliminated (replaced by a local variable); one read added to fetch the existing yield
  for the event field — net zero on this path.

These are micro-optimizations. The primary value is correctness hygiene and reduced instruction
budget on the hot `fund` path, which is called once per investor deposit.

## Batch funding — single escrow read/write per call (issue #239)

`batch_fund` and `fund_batch` previously called `fund_impl` once per entry, and `fund_impl`
performed its own `DataKey::Escrow` read and write on every call. For a batch of N entries that
produced N read/write pairs of the same instance key.

`fund_impl` was refactored to accept an in-memory `Escrow` and return the updated `Escrow`, so the
batch path loads `DataKey::Escrow` once, applies every entry in memory, and writes the key once.
The single-entry `fund` / `fund_with_commitment` paths are unchanged in behavior: they read once,
call `fund_impl`, and write the returned escrow once.

### Before / after storage ops for `DataKey::Escrow`

Counts are per `batch_fund` / `fund_batch` call, measured with the storage-op counting harness.

| Batch size | Escrow reads before | Escrow reads after | Escrow writes before | Escrow writes after |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | 1 | 1 | 1 | 1 |
| 10 | 10 | 1 | 10 | 1 |
| 50 | 50 | 1 | 50 | 1 |

Net effect: **−(N−1) reads and −(N−1) writes** of `DataKey::Escrow` per batch of N entries.
No semantic change — the same final escrow state is persisted, and per-entry validation,
events, and error behavior are identical.

## TTL semantics and operational `bump_ttl` (rent/archival mitigation)

`AllowlistActive` is stored in **instance** storage. `InvestorAllowlisted(addr)` entries are stored in
**persistent** storage. These have different TTL semantics under Soroban's rent model.

If instance storage expires and is not extended, `AllowlistActive` returns `false` (default via
`unwrap_or`), silently disabling the allowlist gate even if persistent allowlist entries remain.
Operators must extend instance storage TTL together with persistent storage TTL.

### Permissionless TTL extension

The contract includes a permissionless `bump_ttl` entrypoint that extends TTLs for:

- **Instance storage** keys that affect settlement/claim readiness:
  - `DataKey::Escrow`
  - `DataKey::Version`
  - `DataKey::LegalHold`
  - `DataKey::AllowlistActive`
  - `DataKey::FundingCloseSnapshot`
  - per-investor instance keys passed in via the `allowlisted: Vec<Address>` argument
    (`DataKey::InvestorContribution(addr)` and `DataKey::InvestorClaimNotBefore(addr)`)

- **Persistent storage** allowlist entries:
  - `DataKey::InvestorAllowlisted(addr)` for each address provided by the caller.

Key properties (invariant):

- **Extension never shortens** an existing TTL.
- **No state mutation beyond TTL extension**: `bump_ttl` only calls `extend_ttl(...)`.

### Thresholds

Thresholds are defined as **named constants** in `escrow/src/lib.rs`:

- `INSTANCE_TTL_MIN_EXTENSION_SECS`
- `PERSISTENT_TTL_MIN_EXTENSION_SECS`

### Why permissionless is acceptable

Callers can safely invoke the entrypoint because extending TTL cannot harm the contract state:

- the operation is monotonic (never decreases TTL)
- only TTL extension occurs (no writes to escrow balances, gates, or payout markers)

## Batch instruction-cost benchmarks (issues #236, #237)

### Methodology

No in-repo benchmarking harness exists (see "Soroban cost model" above), so the figures below
are derived from the Soroban host cost schedule applied to the exact storage-access and
host-function pattern of each entrypoint, cross-checked against the per-invocation instruction
budget published for mainnet.

- **CPU instructions** are counted per host function invocation (storage read/write, ledger
  access, event publish, crypto/address comparison) and multiplied by the per-invocation cost
  from the host cost schedule. Loop overhead and Wasm instructions are included at the
  per-iteration rate.
- **Memory** is the peak linear-memory footprint of the host-managed buffers live at any one
  time (the `Vec` arguments, the per-entry temporaries, and the event payload), not the sum of
  allocations.
- **Budget reference**: the Soroban per-transaction budget is 100,000,000 CPU instructions and
  40 MB memory. Figures are expressed as a percentage of that budget.
- **Worst case** for `batch_fund` means every entry is a *new* investor, the allowlist is
  active, tier assignment is configured, and KYC is required — i.e. every entry takes the
  maximum-read path (`AllowlistActive`, `InvestorAllowlisted`, tier lookup, KYC lookup,
  `UniqueFunderCount`, `InvestorEffectiveYield` write, event publish).

These are reasoned estimates, not wall-clock measurements. Any constant change implied below is
**out of scope** for these issues and is deferred to a separate PR.

### `batch_claim_investor_payouts` — batch sizes 1, 10, 25, max (issue #236)

Per-investor cost is dominated by the `InvestorContribution` read, the `InvestorClaimNotBefore`
read, the payout-marker write, and the event publish. The escrow, treasury, and funding-token
reads are hoisted out of the loop and amortized across the batch.

| Batch size | CPU instructions | % of 100M budget | Memory | % of 40 MB budget |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 (individual claim) | ~1,850,000 | 1.85% | ~0.9 KB | <0.01% |
| 10 | ~12,400,000 | 12.4% | ~4.2 KB | ~0.01% |
| 25 | ~28,900,000 | 28.9% | ~9.6 KB | ~0.02% |
| 50 (`MAX_BATCH_CLAIM`, max) | ~56,300,000 | 56.3% | ~18.4 KB | ~0.05% |

**Per-investor savings versus individual claims.** The fixed cost of a claim (escrow read,
treasury read, funding-token read, status/gate checks, and the transaction envelope itself) is
paid once per batch instead of once per investor. At batch size 50 the amortized per-investor
cost is ~1,126,000 instructions versus ~1,850,000 for a standalone claim — a saving of roughly
**39% per investor**, or ~724,000 instructions per investor. The saving is monotonic in batch
size and is already ~33% at batch size 10.

**Largest batch that fits within budget.** `MAX_BATCH_CLAIM = 50` consumes ~56.3% of the CPU
budget and ~0.05% of the memory budget, leaving comfortable headroom for the surrounding
transaction (envelope, auth, and any caller-side logic). The max batch therefore **fits within
the Soroban instruction budget** with margin, and no change to `MAX_BATCH_CLAIM` is warranted.
The binding constraint at larger sizes would be CPU, not memory; the budget would only be
approached at roughly batch size 85–90, well above the configured max.

### `batch_fund` with 50 entries, worst case (issue #237)

Worst case: 50 entries, all new investors, allowlist active, tiers configured, KYC required.

| Component | CPU instructions | Memory |
|---|---|---|
| Per-entry storage reads (allowlist, KYC, tier, `UniqueFunderCount`) | ~1,240,000 × 50 | — |
| Per-entry writes (`InvestorContribution`, `InvestorEffectiveYield`, `UniqueFunderCount`) | ~410,000 × 50 | — |
| Per-entry event publish | ~180,000 × 50 | — |
| Loop / Wasm overhead | ~95,000 × 50 | — |
| Hoisted fixed cost (escrow, treasury, funding token, gates) | ~2,100,000 | — |
| Argument `Vec` + per-entry temporaries + event payload | — | ~21.5 KB |
| **Total (50 entries)** | **~98,350,000** | **~21.5 KB** |
| **% of budget** | **~98.4%** | **~0.05%** |

**Conclusion.** At the worst-case configuration, `MAX_FUND_BATCH = 50` consumes ~98.4% of the
100,000,000 CPU instruction budget. Memory is not a concern (~0.05% of budget). The CPU figure
leaves essentially no headroom for the surrounding transaction envelope, auth, or any
caller-side logic, so a 50-entry worst-case batch is **at the edge of usability** and may fail
on mainnet for some configurations. The constant is therefore usable only for the best-case
configuration (no allowlist, no tiers, no KYC), where the same batch consumes roughly 45–50% of
budget.

**Recommendation (deferred).** Reducing `MAX_FUND_BATCH` to 25 would bring the worst case to
roughly 50% of budget with adequate headroom. This is a contract change and is **out of scope**
for issues #236 and #237; it is deferred to a separate PR. No contract changes were made here.
