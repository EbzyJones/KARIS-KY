> **Reading order for v5 → v6:** Read [ADR-007](ADR-007-storage-key-evolution.md) (policy, `Rule 5`) first for the high-level additive-key policy; then read [ADR-009](ADR-009-per-investor-persistent-storage.md) for the dedicated rationale, TTL/footprint tradeoffs, and the operator-facing v5 → v6 redeploy plan.

Each ADR links directly to the relevant sections of [`escrow/src/lib.rs`](../../escrow/src/lib.rs).
