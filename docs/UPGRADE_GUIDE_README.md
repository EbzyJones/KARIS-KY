## 🚀 Quick start: Which path am I on?

### I need to upgrade. Where do I start?

**1 min:** Answer this question:
> "Did any `#[contracttype]` struct layout change in my new WASM?"

- **NO** → You're on **Additive WASM Upgrade** (safer, faster)
- **YES** → You're on **Redeploy** (riskier, more complex)

**2 min:** Remember that **every** on-chain code swap now goes through the
guarded two-step flow (`propose_upgrade` → wait out the minimum delay →
`execute_upgrade`). The direct `upgrade` entrypoint is deprecated and gated
behind this flow; do not use it for new upgrades. See
[Two-step upgrade flow](#-two-step-upgrade-flow-propose_upgrade--execute_upgrade)
below.

**5 min:** Read UPGRADE_DOCUMENTATION_INDEX.md to see the two paths

**30 min:** Read the relevant section in MULTI_INSTANCE_UPGRADE_GUIDE.md:
- Additive: Read Part 1 + 2
- Redeploy: Read Part 1 + 3

**Execution:** Print and use UPGRADE_CHECKLIST.md

## 🔐 Two-step upgrade flow (`propose_upgrade` / `execute_upgrade`)

All code swaps are guarded by a propose/execute pair with a mandatory minimum
delay. This prevents a single compromised admin key from swapping the contract
code in one transaction.

### How it works

1. **`propose_upgrade(new_wasm_hash)`** — Admin-only. Records the proposed WASM
   hash and the earliest execution timestamp (`now + MIN_UPGRADE_DELAY`).
   Emits an `upgrade_proposed` event. Proposing again replaces the pending
   proposal and restarts the delay clock.
2. **Wait out the minimum delay.** During this window operators can review the
   proposed hash, verify the build, and coordinate legal hold. Execution before
   the delay elapses is rejected.
3. **`execute_upgrade()`** — Admin-only. Requires a pending proposal whose delay
   has elapsed. Performs the actual WASM swap and emits an `upgrade_executed`
   event. The pending proposal is cleared.

### Interaction with the additive vs. redeploy decision

The propose/execute flow is **orthogonal** to the additive-vs-redeploy choice —
it only governs *how* the new WASM is applied, not *which* path you take:

| Path | What the guarded flow does |
|------|----------------------------|
| **Additive WASM Upgrade** | `propose_upgrade(new_hash)` then `execute_upgrade()` after the delay. Same contract ID; rollback is another propose/execute pair with the previous hash. |
| **Redeploy** | The new instance is deployed and initialized normally; the guarded flow applies only if you later upgrade that instance's WASM in place. |

### Operator rules

- Never call the deprecated direct `upgrade` entrypoint; it is gated behind the
  new flow and will be removed at the next interface version bump.
- Always confirm the delay has elapsed before calling `execute_upgrade()`.
- Treat the proposal window as a review gate: verify the hash, run the
  pre-upgrade checklist, and complete legal hold coordination inside it.
- Record both the proposal and execution events in the upgrade record.

## 🔒 Safety highlights

### Additive WASM Upgrade
- ✓ Zero downtime (concurrent investor operations OK)
- ✓ Easy rollback (revert WASM hash anytime)
- ✓ Single contract ID unchanged
- ⚠️ Requires new `DataKey` variants only (no struct changes)

### Redeploy
- ⚠️ New contract ID (all integrators must update)
- ⚠️ Manual investor data restoration
- ⚠️ Hard rollback (requires off-chain recovery)
- ✓ Handles breaking struct changes
- ✓ Clean slate for initialization

### Both paths include:
- Guarded two-step upgrade (`propose_upgrade` → delay → `execute_upgrade`)
- Legal hold coordination (blocks operations during upgrade)
- Testnet staging before mainnet
- Pre-flight build/test/lint verification
- Post-upgrade monitoring (1h, 24h, 72h checkpoints)
- Rollback procedures (additive: fast; redeploy: emergency response)
- Typed error reference (escrow-error-messages.md)
