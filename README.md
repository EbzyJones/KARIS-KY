# karis-ky Escrow Contracts

Soroban smart contracts for karis-ky, the invoice liquidity network on Stellar.
This repository contains the `escrow` contract that holds investor funds for
tokenized invoices until settlement and is maintained under the `karis-ky` project name.

## Getting started (full stack)

This repository ships five cooperating pieces. The contract is the source of
truth; everything else is a client of it.

- **`escrow/`** — the Soroban contract. Build with `cargo build`, test with `cargo test`.
- **`sdk-ts/`** — TypeScript SDK wrapping the contract's typed client and contract types.
- **REPL / CLI** — the Stellar CLI pointed at the locally deployed contract for ad-hoc calls.
- **`backend/`** — indexer and HTTP API that reads contract events and serves the frontend.
- **`frontend/`** — investor-facing UI that talks to the backend API.

### Run everything locally

1. **Prerequisites** — Rust 1.70+ (stable), the `wasm32v1-none` target
   (`rustup target add wasm32v1-none`), Node.js 18+, and the Soroban / Stellar CLI.

2. **Start the local chain and deploy the contract** — one command sets up a
   local Soroban validator, identities, a test token, and a deployed contract:

   ```bash
   source scripts/local-env.sh
   ```

   This exports the environment variables (RPC URL, network passphrase,
   contract ID, identities) that the SDK, REPL, backend, and frontend all read.

3. **Build and exercise the contract directly (REPL / CLI)** — with the
   environment sourced, use the Stellar CLI to call the deployed contract, e.g.
   `stellar contract invoke --id $CONTRACT_ID -- <entrypoint> ...`.

4. **Build the TypeScript SDK** —

   ```bash
   cd sdk-ts
   npm install
   npm run build
   npm run example
   ```

5. **Run the backend** — start the indexer + API against the local chain
   (see [`backend/`](backend/) for its own setup and env vars).

6. **Run the frontend** — point it at the backend API and open it in a browser
   (see [`frontend/`](frontend/) for its own setup and env vars).

A new contributor can follow steps 1–6 in order to run the full stack locally.

## FAQ

**How do I run the tests?**
Run `cargo test` from the repository root to execute the full workspace test suite, or `cargo test -p karis-ky_escrow` to target the escrow crate only. CI mirrors these commands, so a green local run is a good pre-push signal.
See also: [Quick start](#quick-start) and [`escrow/`](escrow/).

**What is the current schema version?**
The authoritative version is the `SCHEMA_VERSION` constant in `escrow/src/lib.rs`, stored on-chain under `DataKey::Version` at `init`. The current value is `7`; production instances should match the deployed WASM.
See also: [Schema version changelog](#schema-version-changelog-datakeyversion).

**Which tokens are supported?**
The escrow binds a single funding token at `init` via the `FundingToken` key, so any SEP-41 / Soroban-compatible token contract can be used. The token is fixed for the lifetime of the escrow and cannot be changed after initialization.
See also: [Escrow init parameters](docs/escrow-init-parameters.md).

**How do I perform a legal hold?**
Without a configured guardian, the admin calls `set_legal_hold` to activate or clear a compliance hold. With a guardian, the admin calls `propose_legal_hold` and the guardian calls `confirm_legal_hold` to activate; the admin still clears the hold. Legal hold is distinct from a dispute pause and is coordinated per the operator runbook.
See also: [`docs/OPERATOR_RUNBOOK.md`](docs/OPERATOR_RUNBOOK.md).

**What happens if the admin key is lost?**
Admin-gated operations (legal hold, dispute pause, attestations, cloning) become unavailable, so admin keys should be held in governance multisig / custody. Recovery requires redeploying or re-initializing under a new admin per the runbook; there is no on-chain key-recovery path.
See also: [Release runbook: build, deploy, verify](#release-runbook-build-deploy-verify).

**What is a dispute pause and how does it differ from a legal hold?**
`pause_dispute` temporarily freezes an escrow due to a dispute, and `resume_dispute` (or auto-expiration) lifts it; `is_dispute_paused` / `get_dispute_pause` report the state. It is a separate mechanism from `set_legal_hold`, which is a compliance control.
See also: [Escrow contract — public entrypoints](#escrow-contract--public-entrypoints).

**How is the maturity date enforced?**
`settle` requires SME auth and enforces the invoice maturity date, so a funded escrow cannot be settled before maturity. Maturity is set at `init` and is part of the stored `InvoiceEscrow`.
See also: [Escrow init parameters](docs/escrow-init-parameters.md).

**How do yield tiers work?**
`fund_with_commitment` records the first deposit with an optional lock period and selects a tiered yield from the `YieldTierTable`. Per-investor effective yield is stored under `InvestorEffectiveYield` and used at claim time.
See also: [Escrow fund parameters](docs/escrow-fund-parameters.md).

**How do I migrate an existing escrow?**
Call `migrate(from_version)`, which currently emits typed errors on all paths (codes 90–92) and has no silent migration path to version 6. Additive-key upgrades need no `migrate` call, but struct-layout changes require a redeploy or an explicit migration implementation.
See also: [`migrate` entrypoint — typed error semantics](#migrate-entrypoint--typed-error-semantics).

**How do I set up the REPL / CLI?**
Source `scripts/local-env.sh` to spin up a local Soroban validator, identities, test token, and a deployed contract in one command. Then use the Stellar CLI (or the TypeScript SDK) to interact with the deployed contract.
See also: [Local development (one-command)](#local-development-one-command) and [TypeScript SDK](#typescript-sdk).

## Prerequisites

- Rust 1.70+ (stable)
- `wasm32v1-none` target for WASM builds: `rustup target add wasm32v1-none`
- Soroban / Stellar CLI (optional — for deployment and contract interaction)

For local development and CI, Rust alone is sufficient.

### SDK Examples

Common integration patterns are demonstrated in [`examples/basic_workflow.rs`](examples/basic_workflow.rs):
init, fund, settle, claim, tiered yield, oracle settlement, and NFT minting workflows.

---

## Quick start

```bash
cargo build
cargo test
```

### Local development (one-command)

```bash
source scripts/local-env.sh
```

This sets up a complete local Soroban environment — validator, identities,
test token, and deployed contract — ready for development. See
[scripts/local-env.sh](scripts/local-env.sh) for details.

### TypeScript SDK

```bash
cd sdk-ts
npm install
npm run build
npm run example
```

See [`sdk-ts/`](sdk-ts/) for the typed client wrapper, contract types, and example usage.

## Schema version changelog (`DataKey::Version`)

The `SCHEMA_VERSION` constant in `escrow/src/lib.rs` is stored on-chain under
`DataKey::Version` at [`init`] and is the authoritative version for upgrade
decisions. All production instances should have this value match the deployed
WASM.

| Version | Description | Upgrade path |
|---------|-------------|--------------|
| 1 | Initial schema (`InvoiceEscrow` v1, basic funding / settle) | N/A |
| 2 | Added per-investor yield keys (`InvestorEffectiveYield`, `InvestorClaimNotBefore`) | Additive keys — no `migrate` call required for read compatibility |
| 3 | Added `FundingCloseSnapshot`, `MinContributionFloor`, `MaxUniqueInvestorsCap`, `UniqueFunderCount` | Additive keys — old instances return `None` / `0` defaults |
| 4 | Added attestation API (`PrimaryAttestationHash`, `AttestationAppendLog`) | Additive keys — no `migrate` call required |
| 5 | Added `YieldTierTable` (`fund_with_commitment`), `RegistryRef`, `Treasury`; tightened `InvoiceEscrow` layout | **Redeploy required** if `InvoiceEscrow` struct layout differs from stored XDR |
| 6 | Moved per-investor keys to persistent storage to bound instance footprint and decouple per-address TTL | **Redeploy required** — prior instances must be redeployed to pick up new storage locations |
| 7 | Added `DisputePaused` state for temporary dispute resolution (separate from legal hold) | Additive keys — no `migrate` call required |

> **Current:** `SCHEMA_VERSION = 8`

## Storage-only upgrade policy (additive fields)

**Compatible without redeploy** when you only:

- Add **new** `DataKey` variants and/or new `#[contracttype]` structs stored
  under **new** keys.
- Read new keys with `.get(...).unwrap_or(default)` so missing keys behave as
  "unset" on old deployments.

**Requires new deployment or explicit migration** when you:

- Change the layout or XDR shape of an existing stored type (e.g. add a
  required field to `InvoiceEscrow` without a migration that rewrites
  `DataKey::Escrow`).
- Rename or change the XDR shape of an existing `DataKey` variant used in
  production.

### `migrate` entrypoint — typed error semantics

`LiquifactEscrow::migrate(from_version)` emits typed [`EscrowError`](docs/escrow-error-messages.md)
codes in all current cases. There is **no silent migration path** from any prior version to
version 6. Callers must not assume it will do bookkeeping work:

| Condition | Typed error (code) |
|-----------|-------------------|
| `stored != from_version` | `MigrationVersionMismatch` (90) |
| `from_version >= SCHEMA_VERSION` | `AlreadyCurrentSchemaVersion` (91) |
| Any `from_version < SCHEMA_VERSION` | `NoMigrationPath` (92) |

See [`docs/escrow-error-messages.md`](docs/escrow-error-messages.md) for the full reference.

To add a real migration path (e.g. rewrite `DataKey::Escrow` after a struct
field change), implement the transformation inside `migrate` before the final
typed error and update `DataKey::Version`.
